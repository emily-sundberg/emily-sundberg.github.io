    "text": "I’m originally from Seattle, Washington, and I’m 24 years old.\nI studied Abstract Mathematics and Chinese Studies at Clemson University in Clemson, SC, graduating in December 2023.\nAfter graduation, I moved to San Antonio, Texas to take my current job as a Management Analyst for the Air Force Manpower Analysis Agency.\nI really love my job because I get to travel a lot — this past spring, I even spent two weeks in South Korea! ✈️\n\n\nHobbies & Interests\n\n🧶 Knitting\n\n🧗‍♀️ Rock climbing\n\n🏈 Watching football\n\n🎵 Country music\n\n📚 Reading\n\n🏄‍♀️ Wakesurfing\n\nIn my free time, you can usually find me cheering on the Seattle Seahawks while knitting a gift that’s probably three months late. 😅\nA fun fact about me, is that I scored a 1 on the Putnam Exam."
